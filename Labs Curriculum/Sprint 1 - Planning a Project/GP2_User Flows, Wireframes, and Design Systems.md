## Purpose

If you aren't a designer yourself, what's the point in learning about user flows or design systems? I don't know — do you think knowing what the experience of eating food is like would be valuable knowledge for a chef? Yeah. Probably.

Whatever you're building isn't being built to remain untouched in a static-free chamber somewhere. You're building it so people can use it. It's worth taking the time to understand how they'll interact with it.

## Lesson

Your instructor will accompany you through two IWY loops (I do, We do, You do) in today's guided project. Here's what to expect:

### *I Do*

#### Overview of userflows, wireframing, and design systems

* Your instructor walks you through a high-level overview of userflows, wireframing, design systems, and how they work together.
  
#### User flows

* Your instructor pulls up Whimsical, gives a quick tour, and demonstrates creating userflow for a simple application.

### *We Do*

#### User flow as a group

* Your instructor guides you through a basic app for capturing and storing photos of your children's art and schoolwork.

#### Creating user flows for your projects

* Your instructor directs you to create user flows for your own projects using Whimsical.
  
#### Reviewing user flows

* Your instructor asks you to post screenshots of your user flows; you then critique them together.

#### Wireframes

* Your instructor pulls up Whimsical and demonstrates how to go about turning user flow into wireframe.

#### Wireframing an app together

* Your instructor leads you in wireframing the children's schoolwork storage app together.

### *You Do*

#### Wireframing your project

* Your instructor directs you to create wireframes for your own projects using Whimsical.
  
### BREAK

### *I Do* (2)

#### Color, type, shape, iconography

* Your instructor discusses using simple design decisions to achieve well designed apps. Your instructor explains how simple choices can influence the "personality" of each app, and how these choices should correspond to a specific user type. You'll review examples of clever design choices combined with wireframes in some great hi-fi apps.

### *We Do* (2)

#### Making design choices for your app

* Your instructor directs you to make some choices about your own app and explain why you chose what you did.

#### Implementing styles

* Your instructor demonstrates setting styles and how to use them effectively in the scaffolding.

#### Best practices for implementing styles

* Your instructor walks through implementation best practices with you.

### *You Do* (2)

#### Implementing sample design choices

* Your instructor directs you to practice setting design styles on your own.
