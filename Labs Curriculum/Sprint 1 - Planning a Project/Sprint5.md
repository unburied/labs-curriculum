# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 5

**This is very similar to sprint 1, but your answers should focus on features from release 2**

## Objectives

- Student can articulate breaking down a release into individual tasks.
- Student can accurately defend scope or timeline of an individual task
- Students will be able to articulate tradeoffs for architectural and design decisions

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Process

Hiring managers don't just want to see what you built, they want to see the reasoning behind it. Here are some questions surveyed hiring managers said they would ask about a project:

- "How did you decide what to build?"
- "Why is this feature important?"
- "Was this a good choice? What would you do differently if you had to do it over again?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. Please answer the following questions as you would in an interview. Remember, hiring managers care about the **process** and the **why** of building something even more than the what.

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe your **process** of breaking release 2 into user stories. What changed from release 1? What conversations did you have with your team to determine release 2 features?
2. Choose a user story from release 2. Describe your **reasoning** as you broke down that particular user story into individual tasks.
3. Choose a user story from release 1 that you worked on. How long did it take to ship? Did it take longer than expected? Why / Why not? 

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Technical Decisions

On the job, you'll be making technical decisions every day. Hiring managers want to see how you make a choice and how you communicate your decisions. Here are some examples of questions they might ask about one of your projects in an interview:

- "What kind of database did you choose and why?"
- "Why did you use X to do Y?"

These sorts of questions inform your entire labs experience. You made a few technical decisions this week. We want to see how you would communicate them in an interview.

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe a technical decision you made for release 2. How did you make that decision?
2. What are some of the risks given the decision you made?
3. Given the architecture you decided on in sprint 1, what challenges arose? Did you foresee these challenges?
