# Sprint Challenge: Sprint 6

**This is very similar to sprint 1, but your answers should focus on features from release 2**



## Objectives

- Student can articulate their delivery process in contributing to and completing individual tasks.
- Student can demonstrate, in detail, how their solution relates to the specification and architectural standards.
- Student can articulate the challenges and lessons learned from managing their time working on a complex project in a team.

## Prompt 1 - Communicating Individual Contribution

On the job, you will be responsible for shipping features regularly. Engineers are given tickets and are expected to deliver them. Hiring managers want to see that you are capable of delivering a feature.

Here are some examples of hiring manager interview questions:

- "Tell me about a project you've built."
- "What were some technical challenges on that project? How did you overcome them?"

We took these questions and cooked them into your labs experience. This week, you should have shipped at least one feature. Answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. Describe something you have built in the last 6 weeks. Link the relevant pull requests or paste screenshots of code. 
2. How does what you built contribute to the overall product your team is building? What user problems does it help solve?
3. Describe your delivery process for what you built this week from ideation to breakdown to implementation. What challenges occurred during the delivery process that you didn't foresee? Explain your technical solution in detail.

## Prompt 2 - Communicating Teamwork

As a software developer, you will almost always be on a team. As a result, engineering hiring managers want to see how you work on a team. As a junior developer, you will often pair with seniors on features. Here are some examples of interview questions you may get asked concerning teamwork:

- "Tell me about a time you worked on a team. What was hard about it?"
- "What is your greatest weakness as a team player? How have you improved?"

This week we taught you how to pair with other team members. You should have worked with at least one other person to deliver a feature. Reflect on that experience and answer the following questions like you would in an interview:

### Questions you need to answer

1. How did you work with another team member to deliver a feature in these last 6 weeks? What roles have you played?
2. What did you learn from working in a team these last 6 weeks? How are you going to improve your teamwork in the future?

## Prompt 3 - Professional Development Resume Updates

Update your project on your resume with more technical details of what has been built on your project.

**Your submission for Prompt 3 should be a link to your resume**
