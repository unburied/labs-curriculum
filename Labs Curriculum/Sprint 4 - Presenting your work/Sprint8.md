## Hiring Manager Inspiration
Here are some quotes from hiring managers about presenting work:

"We’re looking for candidates with evidence of strong writing/communication skills, having created multiple projects during their education that are thoughtfully displayed in some way (blog, github, anything) and personal passion from them about our company/mission."

"We’re looking for candidates with a learning mindset and enthusiasm for sharing knowledge and interests."

"We love to see passion and a desire to continue learning, to work with cool technologies, to fill gaps in their knowledge."

## Prompt 1 - Curating your blog

You can either edit your old blog from sprint 4 OR create an new blog. The edited / new blog should include:

- a paragraph on the background of the product + organization
- a paragraph on recent technical challenges including code snippets
- a pargraph reflecting on your labs experience

Submit a link to your blog.

## Prompt 2 - Share your blog (Optional)

You just wrote something awesome! Time to share it with the world. If you'd like, write a Linkedin and/or Twitter post that succinctly describes what your blog is about and includes a link. Extra credit if you get Austen to retweet 😉.
